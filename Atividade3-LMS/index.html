			<h2>Poker Tools - c-bet</h2>
			<p>
        When you follow up your pre-flop raise with a bet on the flop (whether you hit or not), it's termed a continuation bet, or c-bet.
A continuation bet takes advantage of the initiative you gain by being the pre-flop aggressor, and carries it over onto the flop

				<h5>Bluff</h5>
				<p> In the card game of poker, a bluff is a bet or raise made with a hand which is not thought to be the best hand.
          To bluff is to make such a bet. The objective of a bluff is to induce a fold by at least one opponent who holds a
          better hand. The size and frequency of a bluff determines its profitability to the bluffer.
          By extension, the phrase "calling somebody's bluff" is often used outside the context of poker to describe
          cases where one person "demand[s] that someone prove a claim" or prove that he or she "is not being deceptive."</p>

				<h5>Raise</h5>
				<p>n the game of poker, the play largely centers on the act of betting, and as such,
          a protocol has been developed to speed up play, lessen confusion, and increase security while playing.
          Different games are played using different types of bets, and small variations in etiquette exist between cardrooms,
          but for the most part the following rules and protocol are observed by the majority of poker players.</p>

	<h5>Range</h5>
		<p>A range is a number of hands that depends on the game situation and that develops while the hand plays out.
While amateurs often try to “put their opponent on a hand,” professional players put them on a set of most likely hands in a specific situation and then try to cut away single hands from this set as the hand plays out.
Here’s a very simple, theoretical example. A very tight player raises from early position. His range is A-A, K-K, Q-Q, A-K, and maybe J-J.</p>

			<h5>Tells</h5>
			<p>Players who are relatively new to no-limit hold'em sometimes overvalue the importance of "tells" in poker.
        By tells we're referring to those actions, either physical or verbal, players make at the table
        that might give away information about the strength of their hands. In any live poker game,
        especially at the lower limits, it isn't uncommon to see players revealing information via such
        tells without being aware they are doing so. Players also will deliberately act in certain ways or
        say certain things to try to deceive
        their opponents, and thus might give away information to others who are able to see through such performances.</p>
